You can find the
[backend repository here](https://github.com/codeableorg/expensable-api), it
includes an `insomnia.json` file that shows all the available endpoints. Your
component should be showcase on Storybook.

## Take into consideration:

- The API doesn’t have information about the Icon or the Color of the category.
  Use random icons and colors for your solution.
- You can choose any month as the “current” month.

The base repository includes all the work previously done:

- Reset styles
- Typography
- Colors
- Button component
- SidebarNav component
- Calculator component
